/* 
At Zillow, they offer a Zillow Offer (no obligation) 

This is basically a Custom Market Analysis with an offer. Some may call this a home evaluation, but that doesn't really encapsulate the completeness of a Custom CMA/Offer.

Check out this link: https://www.zillow.com/offers/?t=seo_io-menu/
https://www.youtube.com/embed/Bih3Avdd67w 

Here are the video's instructions: Just provide some basic information about you home, and if eligible, Zillow will send you a free no obligation offer within a few days. 
Use case (very convincing): Client opens the Zillow app, walks from room to room taking pictures, post it, and that's it. Contacted in two days. Sold in less than a week. Closed two weeks later.
Our offer is based on the information you provide along with a CMA done by a local real estate agent. We send you the offer and you decide what happens next.
If you like the offer, a home inspection will be arranged. After the inspection (evaluation, determination, etc), the offer is finalized and you can move forward.
Then it's time to pick your closing date.
